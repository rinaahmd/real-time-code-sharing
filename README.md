# üñ•Ô∏è Real-Time Code Sharing System

A modern, real-time code sharing platform designed for educational environments. Students can instantly share their code with lecturers through a VSCode extension, while lecturers monitor submissions through a beautiful web interface with AI-powered code review.

## üéØ Quick Start (First Time)

**Setup Steps (run once):**
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` in `backend-server`, `lecturer-interface`, and `vscode-extension`
2. Build extension: `cd vscode-extension && npm run build`
3. Start servers: `.\start-servers.ps1`
4. Create students: `.\create-students-simple.ps1`
5. Install extension in each VSCode instance

**Daily Use:**
1. Start servers: `.\start-servers.ps1`
2. Access: `http://localhost:3000`

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### **Step 1: Start the Backend and Frontend Servers**

![System Startup](docs/screenshots/02-system-startup.png)
*Starting both servers*

```bash
.\start-servers.ps1
```

Or start them individually:
```bash
# Start backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend-server
npm start

# Start frontend (Terminal 2)
cd lecturer-interface
npm start
```

**Access Points:**
- **Lecturer Interface**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3001`

### **Step 2: Create Student VSCode Instances**

![Student VSCode Instances](docs/screenshots/multiple-vs-instance.png)
*Multiple VSCode windows for students*

```bash
.\create-students-simple.ps1
```

This will open 4 VSCode instances for students:
- Alice Johnson
- Bob Smith
- Charlie Brown
- Diana Prince

### **Step 3: Build and Install VSCode Extension**

The extension needs to be built first, then installed.

**Building the Extension:**
```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install

# Install vsce if not already installed
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Build the extension
npm run compile
vsce package
```

This creates the `code-sharing-extension-1.0.0.vsix` file in the `vscode-extension` folder.

**Installing the Extension:**

![Extension Installation](docs/screenshots/04-extension-installation.png)
*Installing the code sharing extension*

1. Open each student VSCode instance
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
4. Select `vscode-extension\code-sharing-extension-1.0.0.vsix`

**Note:** The VSIX file must be built before installing it. Run the build commands above if you haven't already.

### **Step 4: Access Lecturer Interface**

![Empty Dashboard](docs/screenshots/05-empty-dashboard.png)
*Lecturer interface ready for submissions*

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

### **3. Lecturer Views**

#### **First Submission Appears**

![First Submission](docs/screenshots/14-first-submission.png)
*Lecturer interface showing first submission*

When a student shares code:
- The submission appears instantly in the lecturer interface
- You can see student name, code, language, and timestamp
- Statistics update automatically

- **Correct**: Number of correct answers (based on AI review)
- **Active Q**: Number of currently active questions

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Servers Won't Start**
```bash
# Kill all Node.js processes
taskkill /f /im node.exe

# Restart servers
.\start-servers.ps1
```

### **VSCode Extension Not Working**
- Make sure the extension is installed in each VSCode instance
- Check if servers are running on ports 3000 and 3001
- Restart VSCode if needed

### **Database Issues**
```bash
# Check data directory
ls backend-server/data/

# Ensure write permissions
icacls backend-server\data /grant Everyone:F
```

### **AI Review Giving Bad Grades**
The AI review system has been updated to give generous scores (80-100%) for correct code. If you're getting low scores:
1. Restart the backend server
2. Make sure the latest code is running

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - Required for running servers and building extension
- **VSCode** - Required for the extension
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **npm** - Usually comes with Node.js

## ‚öôÔ∏è Complete Setup (First Time Only)

### **Install Dependencies for Backend:**
```bash
cd backend-server
npm install
```

### **Install Dependencies for Frontend:**
```bash
cd lecturer-interface
npm install
```

### **Build VSCode Extension:**
```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install

# Install vsce (Visual Studio Code Extension manager) globally if not already installed
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Compile and package the extension
npm run compile
vsce package
```

This will create the `code-sharing-extension-1.0.0.vsix` file that you'll install in VSCode.

**Alternative (if vsce is installed):**
```bash
cd vscode-extension
vsce package --out code-sharing-extension-1.0.0.vsix
```

**Note:** You only need to run these setup commands once. After the first setup, you can just run the servers as shown in Step 1 above.
