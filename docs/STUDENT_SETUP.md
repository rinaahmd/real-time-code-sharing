# ðŸŽ“ Student Setup Guide

Complete guide for students to set up and use the Real-Time Code Sharing system.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **VSCode** installed on your computer
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - for running the system
- **Git** - for cloning the repository

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step 1: System Preparation**

The lecturer will prepare the system by running:
```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend-server
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Start the lecturer interface
cd lecturer-interface
npm install
npm start
```

### **Step 2: Student Instance Creation**

The lecturer will create student instances using one of these methods:

#### **Method A: Interactive PowerShell Script (Recommended)**
```powershell
.\create-custom-students.ps1
```

**What happens:**
1. Script asks for number of students (1-10)
2. You enter your name when prompted
3. VSCode instance opens automatically with your name
4. Your data is stored in `C:\Temp\Students\StudentX`

#### **Method B: Batch File Setup**
```cmd
.\create-custom-students.bat
```

#### **Method C: Configuration File**
```powershell
# Lecturer edits students-config.txt with names
.\create-students-from-config.ps1
```

### **Step 3: VSCode Extension Installation**

Once your VSCode instance is open:

1. **Open Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Search for Extension**: Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
3. **Select Extension**: Choose `vscode-extension\code-sharing-extension-1.0.0.vsix`
4. **Enter Your Name**: When prompted, enter the name you used during setup
5. **Extension Installed**: You'll see the Code Sharing extension in your sidebar

### **Step 4: Verify Installation**

Check that everything is working:
1. **Extension Panel**: Look for "Code Sharing" in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
2. **Your Name**: Should be displayed in the extension panel
3. **Connection Status**: Should show "Connected" to the server
